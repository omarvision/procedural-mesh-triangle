# procedural-mesh-triangle
In Unity 3D we use meshes. The meshes can be the primitive meshes that come with unity. The meshes can be imported from external programs. But the meshes can also be created through code. I'm calling these meshes procedural meshes. Since meshes are made of triangles - the simplest mesh is one triangle. Lets make the triangle mesh in the tutorial through C# script.
